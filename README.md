# go-wxtile
Creating map based on grid data. Currently this code contains scattered code snippets to 

* read a regular world grid
* project it into Mercator and make it regular
* resample a grid
* draw resampled grid into an image

TODO:
Put all snippets together to form a tool that can create a tileset based on downloaded grib (weather) data.
