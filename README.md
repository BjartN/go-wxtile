# go-wxtile
Creating map based on grid data. Currently this code contains scattered code snippets to 

* create a tileset from a gribfile made using grib2json
* read a regular world grid
* project it into Mercator and make it regular
* resample a grid
* draw resampled grid into an image
* ...and, for no good reason, code to test various methods of compression and serialization.
